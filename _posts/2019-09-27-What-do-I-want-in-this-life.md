such as having 3000 $ per 2 months in budget
or getting back 2019/11/21 before.
because Jennie will need to go to visa run.

## Want to speak better English. 
I need to know how to practice English very well. As much as I get used with this language, I can speak and writing better. Then It means that I should have to write and think or speak in this language. I should have to meet the people who speak English as well.

If it is better for goal, I will set a goal with IELTS.
Even I can have 

# There are so many list that I want to achieve.

Of course I should have to believe, I can do that all the things.



You needed to find out all the things
Like a hobby.
I need to wake up very early.
As I feel that early awaken is only way to do all my wishlists.
there is nobody to bother or interfere my jobs.
there is no reason to be bothered


I need to set a goal which is really matter for my Korea's journey
or for whole life.
How do I want to live?



In my case, I will be back to Korea in next month.
I'll practice more English and expanding my influencial affection on Online.
## Because I want to be the one who sharing his own good energy to the world.
Then earning money and keep learning from my resources. I mean 'my resource' is book and experience. I want to expanding myself and getting closer and better in my goal.
## My goal is to live helping people for their life with enough income. 
Why? I want to be rich and keep being capable within social community. I want to find out my capability. someone expresses this, 'Find out best version of me'. I do not know why that is really matter. 
Of course we live only once. However, Do we keep chasing our goals in maximum boost like a 100m runner? Sometimes we just release and letting down all the things. We're not the racing dogs or horses. We do need just follow up our own needs and desires as its pace. As much as the all creatures in nature follow their desires.
I'll own better asset. I want to be rich. although I don't know what is real 'Rich'.

## How can we have the automatical passive income?


## What do I really want to do in my life?
I wanna love a woman who really communicatable with me. I need someone who really understand me not fight. I've became a barren field after a battle. My emotional battery has been way to gone.


I wanna date with another country's woman. Because I believe that would bring something more dynamic chemical in our life. I want to live a little more vivrant one. Not just typically same with my country's standard.
Why? I wanna live my own life. Not follow other's standard. **I want to live what my heart really speaks or follows.**


I guess that is the rich. but it requires so many abilities. Even in Asset, Relationship, Interpersonal skill, softskill and so on.
If I am not rich, that means 'I am not enough to be rich'. That means I need study and learn from this life. Maybe That would be a lesson for asset management, or would be a lesson for free writing. If you can control your all subconciousness, you can change your emotion. Subconcious is the controller of Emotion. If you control your emotion, you can get what you really want. If your subconcious set up for finding out what you really need, You can make the ideal material comes to you.
Because All world is ruled by the Principle of attraction.
Every things that you have is from your mindset, your subconciousness.
