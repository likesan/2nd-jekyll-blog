# That was super awkward.
I mean, She forcefully asked me to watch her screen
Even I was focusing on my job.
I was doing some writing for mine.
However, she just asked me to mind her job in all sudden.
I felt so awkward and difficult with her.
Because It was a moment that she has the character.
The character means, 'forcefully order to do'.
I believe that is a sort of rudeness and violence.

# Whenever Sexual Crime happens, the most common factor is,
They do not care about the victim or opponent's feeling or oppinion.
However they just forcefully asking to fulfill their own satisfactory.

# I found her aspect from her that behavior.
That was super awkward.

although I am a man who can be considered to mistake or to behave forcefully,

# but somehow, she has done that for me.
I felt litterally insane and distracting.
What should I do for this?

Even this wasn't first time to do...
Last argument, she told me 'just cutting off the dirty edge which becomes a distract for woman audience in our instagram'
but That was an order, because I answered her 'That is too difficult for me...'.
Even whenever I try to answer her asking not only one time, but severally answered 'That's too much... I can't'
but she just asked me 'Shut up! just doing whatever you want to do!'.

# That was super distracting me.
Even That has raised my hatress on her, though she has been my gf.

# My refusal is because of my fatigue from caring puppies. 
Whenever I've cared those two skin problem of puppies. **I became totally exhasted and fallen at the fatigue.**
Putting a cream for those skins, Wiping off those foot prints on the white floor, Comporting them stopping those barking, and keep being patient from their barking... Those works were too much distracting all the time.
However I couldn't just surrender those homeworks, but rather I should had to upload Instagram those all jobs what I've done. That can lead the understanding for our audiences why our uploading is too delayed. Yeah, 
# Although all the fatigue and tireness, I'd uploaded the posting.
However she just tackled me because of the dirtyness and imperfection in posting.
That was super distracting even makes me feel furiosness.
**Rather she should had to say some compliments all my efforts and understanding my all fatigue and tirness. Otherwise, She just didn't any postive reaction on my works.**

# That is making me feel so bad.
Even, when I explained why I felt so fatigue and I said that cannot help your demand, rather she didn't try to understand me. 

# Her attitude is too sturbbon.
I understood why she askes me to cutting the edge, but I need to be understood about my all efforts why I fallen at some fatigue and exhaustion.
 
so eventually, she just closed gate furiously, I just laid down on bed exhaustively.

# So now, Finally this awkward 'Forceful order' has happend again...
I feel so bad on her.
Seriously, I will not coming back to Bali unless she seriously apolgizes what she has done to me.'
because I really do not want to be around by a person or people who doesn't respect the opponent.

# How can we solve this problem between her and me
She has to stop the demanding or asking me forcefully, because I cannot stand with that attitude. As much as she can ask me, I have the right to deny or keep doing what I'd done.

Rather she should have ask me politely, what she need to do.
She needs to recognize even her boyfriend can 'deny or refuse' as his free-will.

This is too disgusting.
