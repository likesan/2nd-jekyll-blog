What can I do so?
That was really sick, but we found this is best way to keep peace in between of us.

Yeah
So happy now :D
but of course, it doesn't mean that gurantee my happiness in here.
Rather I wish to go **the Philliphinnes Dhamma Mediation center.**

# Why?

I want to nurish myself up to adequatly able to earning money.
Beside, the 'Dhamma' Viappsana carrier will gain my speciality on my own.
There are many people who do coding, vegan, but not much about the Dhamma meditation, but **this is really unique skill to have.**

because this meditation improves our brain functions 2-3 times more.
Besides, when our brain fatigues on every single day, it needs to recharge. This mediation demands are so huge in intelligent community.
One of case is, 'Google'.
They do meditation, workshop and keep trying to improve their Meditation skill.
**Because  Meditation brings a default network lighten up.**

then what should I prepare for the Meditation trip?

# Preparation

Need to get a flight ticket
understanding how to get the center from Manila.
in their website, they recommands to depart from Manila Subway.
(I'm not sure Philliphines has the Metro or Subway underground..)
