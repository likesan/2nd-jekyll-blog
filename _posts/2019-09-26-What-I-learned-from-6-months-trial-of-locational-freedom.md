# We wanted to capture our blueprint what we've dreamed for.
First, we wanted to have the freedom and capacity wherever we want to be.
but that was not easier than our imagine, because that requires more than our expectation.
ww
## I needed to imagine something more into detail. 
'Just want to be free wherever I go'.
That's too vague and nothingness plan.
because there is any action plan to do.

## Rather accurate and objective numbers needed in our plan. 
Although we'd contracted and earned 2200 $ per month by a company of Korea. The sponsoring company was expecting us to make some Marketing result on Instagram. Then eventually to become the earning platform with connected an their own online shopping mall. Those shopping they have managed for few years since the company launched worked very well.
Then One of team manager expected to us bring them more audience who can be potential customers. 

## we couldn't continue the contract with the company.
There are few reasons. 
### First, My gf denied to meet our sponsor company's CEO.
The CEO has wanted to meet my gf in person, as more as the influence marketing keep going further in work. 
In Korean Company usually askes something sexual demand to woman. 
as much as the woman is like a model or visually attractive, the demand is more required. That's why Jang-Ja-Yeun decided to kill herself so sadly...
well, Even the meeting becomes more private or secret place, the risk of demand some sexual requirement raising up.
My gf had been afraid of meet them in person, because of the sexual risk.

### Second, It seems to raise the risk or to be tied up our freedom tight. 

As much as me eagering to have locational freedom, to get closer the Korean executive manager can tie up our freedom.  Because Average Korea company askes to get closer or face-to-face work environment. 
  1. They believe face-to-face work is better for working together. **They don't follow the world wide job environment changing to be more remotely.** Besides, the company was one of conservative company which isn't favored from young canditates.
  2. Those company system is still leaded within vertical management. Low level of employee's cannot do something for the company rather rest of employee must follow all the boss's order.
  3. They don't follow up the lean strategical approach. They are afraid of doing something different way. I do not know why. Even when we try to sell the pet products for audience, they had been hesitating and afraid of the result. If they know about Lean Startup strategy, They can test an item to the market. However, They have been afraid of failure, then stucked in nothingness. 
  4. Moreover, They didn't try to offering remote communication. Skype or Email, or Reports are the method to communicate each other.

### Third, The sponsor company was always afraid of something new.
**Our engagement is quite higher than any influencers in same follwer counts.**

according to their own resource, nomallly, about 1000 followers account has 4.62% engagements(Likes + Comments/Total followers). However Our account engagement rate was 107%(Likes 1117+32/1074). That was super high. If a person found our post, he commented or liked our post 107%! **107% engagement was a result of our work.**

### forth, she wanted to have more independant resource, not leaning with a company. 
The reason to be more independant, because that doesn't ask us too much stresses. Rather we can do whatever we want! true freedom! As a Youtuber you can do whatever you want. Even Do what is your favor. 
but, after our denial to meet them in person, we stop to futher contracting. 


## So our income resource got stucked
our brain is working with detail action in mind.
We could have to imagine what we will do for the goal and achievement.
But unfortunately, we didn't make any detail goal.
or just our plan wasn't strong enough to recall our actions.

then what can we do?
In my case, I will be back to Korea in next month.
I'll practice more English and expanding my influencial affection on Online.
## Because I want to be the one who sharing his own good energy to the world.
Then earning money and keep learning from my resources. I mean 'my resource' is book and experience. I want to expanding myself and getting closer and better in my goal.
## My goal is to live helping people for their life with enough income. 
Why? I want to be rich and keep being capable within social community. I want to find out my capability. someone expresses this, 'Find out best version of me'. I do not know why that is really matter. 
Of course we live only once. However, Do we keep chasing our goals in maximum boost like a 100m runner? Sometimes we just release and letting down all the things. We're not the racing dogs or horses. We do need just follow up our own needs and desires as its pace. As much as the all creatures in nature follow their desires.
I'll own better asset. I want to be rich. although I don't know what is real 'Rich'.

## What is rich?
Rich means for me, to be full of capability and freedom. If you have enough freedom as much as you can draw on your canvas. You dream what you want, you draw what you want on your page. 
### You do what do you really want. 
You put the activty what you really want to do. **The process itself to achieve the goal is rich itself.** If you make your day with your activities which are on your list, That is the Rich and Achievement. Some people call it 'Bucketlist', 'Priority List','Bulletpoint' and so on.
### The matter is You do what you really want to do, or just want to do.
You need to manage your assset to do all the things. Actually In my country, we call a budget is a bullet to pierce what you're targetting for, as a metaphor. So if you don't manage your bullets, You cannot shoot or knock down your goal or target. You need the bullet. The bullet is money and asset. Because in modern age, every things are made up of Money. How?
This is the capitalism. Everything is made up of money and labour. Money comes from the people who values your work or service. If your content or service values up their life, they will pay for you.
But not only 'working', you can make money to another money. Those we call 'Passive Income'. Thesedays, So many books and articles are obsessed with this concept. Automatical money making model.
## How can we have the automatical passive income?


## What do I really want to do in my life?
I wanna love a woman who really communicatable with me. I need someone who really understand me not fight. I've became a barren field after a battle. My emotional battery has been way to gone.


I wanna date with another country's woman. Because I believe that would bring something more dynamic chemical result in our life. I want to live a little more vivrant one. Not just typically same with my country's standard.
Why? I wanna live my own life. Not follow other's standard. **I want to live what my heart really speaks or follows.**


I guess that is the rich. but it requires so many abilities. Even in Asset, Relationship, Interpersonal skill, softskill and so on.
If I am not rich, that means 'I am not enough to be rich'. That means I need study and learn from this life. Maybe That would be a lesson for asset management, or would be a lesson for free writing. If you can control your all subconciousness, you can change your emotion. Subconcious is the controller of Emotion. If you control your emotion, you can get what you really want. If your subconcious set up for finding out what you really need, You can make the ideal material comes to you.
Because All world is ruled by the Principle of attraction.
Every things that you have is from your mindset, your subconciousness.
