# I want to live better.

I need to keep building the blog by Reactjs. Why? I need better platform for it.
I need to spread my word and idea. I need to people understand what is my strengths and skill. then I could meet the better opportunities.
Well, That is the reason why I try to make another blog, though we can just 1 click to have a blog through another platform.

I want to gain my coding skill.
I believe that is the way to develop my capacity..

# Besides, I found that is very rich and powerful langauge more than we that perceive. 
The usauge boundary is quite wide and generously accepted.
Server side, nodeJS. Frontside, ReactJs and etc. In the bridge, Ajax or Jquery. That is all rounder player. I love that.

Even I want to introduce myself 'SJ, which is reversed JS. I want to reverse this world by JS'. HA XD So funny.


# in 21 centry, I can feel when I could make something well, That is the power, ability and wealthy itself.
I've always dreamed to have a capacity to do something.
but understanding and accurately buildable a program as much as I wish,
That is amazing, because thesedays every wealthy needs the software! Since the smartphone and laptop is everywhere to do some works for people,
We can make a software to do something it.

# Since I've started this ReactJs, I feel so happy.
Somehow, I can make the visual things as much as I could,
I can start to form a platform to spread my voice and thought on the world.
I want to make a change through this.

This is really what I want to do.
So happy thing.



# I'd like to learn the request and respond things in server side as well more deeply

because these writings set it fires my desire to learn that.
Javascript is friendly and easy to learn. Jquery, Ajax, Bootstrap, Firebases and etc. Whenever I've practiced and tried to make my own projects, they were just there so closely to be handled under my hands.


# Well actually when Serverside, and front are together, I feel more fun. 

I thought am a fullstack person.
Of course I've remembered when I firstly succeeded to 4 digit numbers password unlocked by
Java's unlimit for loop number requesters.
I never experience like that before. however, when I did it in first time, in the bootcamp in South Korea,
That was super amazing, even my skin got goosebump.
Yes, I love coding not only serverside, but also frontside itself? or yet, I cannot say surely?
Django was fine but I've liked that as well.
I can send more information to the front, I can send something more backend, 
those all movement are fun themselve.
