Am I doing very well?
actually I do not know
because.. 
**I wanted to have a garden and naturely surrounded with my house in country side.**
Yeah because I wanted to have more freedom with the house
yeah.. 
but this is quite good!

because I can build the lifestyle with Camera!
**I can learn new skill which is very high demand**

All is good...
Coding with Video editing I can learn...
this is quite huge!
although we do not make a permanent aliving...
but alone, when it comes, I can use this skill.

then what is a matter from now?
need to understand `always top list first`
then it's prerequisite to have the arranged list by priority sequences.

Then what should I do for tomorrow?
Need to note down what should I'll do?
how to know what should I do for tomorrow?

the note...

I should make my own life opportunity.
of course keep figuring out a skill is very good!
but... I need to know the permaculture lifestyle.. but it's for a 

I'm thinking about what should I do?
Top in priorities

## To visit Villa Kitty

* [ ] Vaccination on him
* [ ] Adoption one more

What do I need?
Wifi!


Actually the biggest desire is to have practicing on permaculture
because it's the only way to affect on people to motivate them to have more nature

Have nature,
Happy in nature

## what I want to do?

Lovely things...
yeah but nurishing my skills are the first one.
What's real first in my life?

# Keep dreaming!!!!!!

because, whether I get rich money or not, the skill is instintively relative with the skill.
that will determine my happiness while live on the day.
then the skill is matter?
yes!
but the how to visualizing my dream is really matter!
If I don't dream a real dream what my heart really persuit, It doesn't happen, beside, it can result unhappy life.

yeah.. so I should have to keep dreaming... for my life.
but how can I get my own dream so much?

지금 이제너두 방주를 탔을 때 기술, 장비를 만들어놓아야한다.
언제든 다른 곳으로 가도 안정적인 삶.
평화, 정신의 안정.


1. 사진 선정, 보정, 편집, 영상 편집 쪽을 승진이가 맡기로 했다.

2. 정식 직원으로 만들고 싶다.

    각자 급여가 들어온다.
    스스로 자립심이 커진다.
    위태로운 상태에서 벗어나기 위함

3. 승진이에게 능력을 만들어주고 싶다.

    이제너두가 됐다해도, 다른 회사로 넘어갈 수 있는 능력
    보험, 갈아탈 곳, 능력이 필요하다.
