# I feel headache with this person..

cannot communicate properly...
unlogic.
stupid.

I cannot understand how she can treat me like this.
this is freaking abnosious.


I feel so difficult this type of person.
she is such bad.
I really dont know what should I do.


# Being together is such a painful

because I couldn't understand this one.
maybe she thinks that I am not productive.

Am I?
no
because I measure my main activities, and quantify them
to act reasonably, accurate.
keep looking for another opportunity.

Whatever I do, her way is so strict.
She just does only what she wants.

I cannot make her satisfied.
yeah her taste is so badly different with me.

She is crazy of top of crazy.
She always determines every problems cause of lack of note.
just she wants hang around with noting person.
me? Do I want it?
not at all.
why? it just totally burden for my life style.

She is just unconversationable person.


Does it?
no..
Everyday, I calcultate my all works, top activities.


Sound yoga or something...
just a meditation is so good.

I cannot lead her to follow mine.
That's pretty suck.

To live alone seems far better.
**No stress, No pain, More freedom, More Experience..**

but I like her.
I like her other ways.

Meaningless person.
What should I focus on then?

# Let's go?

no, another option setting.
yeah need to plan B to stand alone.
