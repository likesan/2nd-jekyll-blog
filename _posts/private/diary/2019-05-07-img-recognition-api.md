I found that would be far better if can identify the picture whether it's heatlhy one or not.

Because as our concept is 'vegan' and 'healing' contents on instagram, 
we should not follow or like on picture which contains any animal cruelty or toxic things.

but as much as we use the instagram marketing tool, this tool randomly follows or persue some 'bad' contents.

because it couldn't identify the images mean..


There are 3 options for me. 
1. Google cloud API 
2. not3. Google Tensorflow API
