It's lovely day..
What can I do so?
My English wasn't perfect to understand what the instructor said.

So I felt a shameness because I had to hear 'follow her!'

Heh..
I do not know.. what to do for better understanding.
Perhaps I need to do some more shadowing with English Drama?

Hm...
What can I do so..?
Do what is really matter first!

Check the values or quantify the value.
on Excel. It's first to do **priotization**.
